# openstack-libvirt
OpenStack environment using Libvirt, Ansible and Vagrant

# Steps to create an OpenStack project

1. In the host machine, create an Open vSwitch bridge called openstack-sw and also define a network in libvirt using the XML file vlan-trunking.xml
1. Define the number of nodes: deployment, load balancer, controller, compute, network, ceph, swift, cinder, etc. in Vagrantfile
1. Update the file inventory.txt (this is an Ansible inventory file).
1. Add the OpenStack configuration files in openstack-ansible/files/openstack_deploy. These files define your OpenStack deployment and will be copied to /etc/openstack_deploy in the deployment node.
1. Execute: ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt site.yaml. This will set up the virtual machines and it'll get them ready for OpenStack.
1. Log into the OpenStack deployment node and execute.
    1. cd /opt/openstack-ansible/playbooks
    1. openstack-ansible setup-hosts.yml
    1. openstack-ansible haproxy-install.yml # If using Load Balancer nodes
    1. openstack-ansible setup-infrastructure.yml
    1. openstack-ansible setup-openstack.yml
  
# Currently the project supports the following:

1. Creating a dynamic multinode enviroment (number of nodes can be specified in the Vagrantfile). Currently, only the following nodes can be created: lb, deployment, controller, compute and network.
1. Network interface bonding in the virtual machines that made up the OpenStack environment.
1. VLAN's support for the storage, container and tenant networks.
1. Flat network support for provider networks.
